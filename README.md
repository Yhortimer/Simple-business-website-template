# Simple-business-website-template.

That's the simple business website template. I created that to level up my skill in front-end development. Nevertheless, this template is well laid out and fully responsible. You can freely use it for whatever you want to without any sort of contribution.

Project tech stack:

1. HTML;
2. CSS (SASS);
3. JavaScript.
